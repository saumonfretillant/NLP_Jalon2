            "I love Greek food and have eaten at many Greek restaurants in Atlanta and New York.  Since I live less than 1.5 miles from this relatively new restaurant, I decided to finally give it a try.  The initial reviews on various sites for this restaurant were not great when they first opened a couple of months ago, but I felt it was time to have ironed out any issues with the food.  Unfortunately, the food was not worth a return trip.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Although the staff was very friendly and provided good service, it could not make up for the overall experience.  As a small side complaint , the decor of the restaurant was a bit over the top on the tacky side with lots of neon and seemed very cold with too much echo because the walls are covered in various marble tiles and cut glass mirrors.  It reminds me of some of the over-the-top diners in Long Island.  The decor and lighting was a bit distracting during the meal, and the lighting was definitely too bright for an evening dinner.  This is not the place for an intimate or romantic dinner.  It would be great for a large group, I suppose, especially if you are into watching TV from almost every angle while you eat.\n",

            "Starting out with appetizers for 2, we spent $19...ordered a spanakopita (7.95) and their combination plate of dips (10.95).  The spanakopita, which has always been a favorite of mine, was not good at all and was far too greasy with not enough dough for the copious amount of spinach.  The flavor was very bland and tasted like they skimped on ingredients or either it was just a pre-made frozen dish.  I have had better spanakopita from the grocery store freezer if that tells you how disappointing this dish was...especially since most Greek restaurants do a good job with this popular dish.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The combination of dips was mediocre, but I did really like the spicy feta cheese dip.  Out of the ice-cream-scoop-sized selections, it was the only one that I can say was really tasty.  Their Taramousalata was just as bland as what you would find at the grocery store in a jar and did not taste at all like it was made on the premises.  Furthermore, I would consider their pita bread to be slightly below average in taste and texture for a Greek restaurant.  It was not any better than what you would find at the local grocery store full of preservatives. \n",

            "For dinner, we chose wraps (7.95-8.95).  The problem with both wraps was they were OVERLOADED to the point of frustration with lettuce and TONS of onion.  I love onion, but I had to take apart the wrap to remove a giant handful... and more and more shredded onion kept coming out!  it was just too much!  There was also WAY too much lettuce.  This restaurant does what many others do...which is load up the wraps and sandwiches with the cheaper stuff like lettuce, sauce and onion and skimp on the tomato, feta, olives, meat, etc.  We removed half of the lettuce and half of the onion which brought the wrap down to a normal and manageable size to eat.  However, that left us with very little else in the wrap since the meat, feta, etc was in such small quantity.  This is definitely a case where bigger was not better.  My sister said the flavor of her gyro meat was good, though.  \n",

            "Perhaps my biggest surprise was how terrible the fries and Greek potatoes were.  The fries had a burned oil flavor...they were extremely hard, overcooked, and may well be the worst french fries I have ever eaten aside from when I accidentally burn the frozen kind in the oven at home.  The Greek potatoes were definitely better than the fries, but tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  The texture of oven roasted potatoes should be soft but not mushy, sticky and wet.  The lemony flavor was pretty good, but they just didn't taste fresh at all...the taste was more akin to \"microwaved leftovers\" since they were overcooked and reheated.\n",
            "\n",
            "The sweet tea was good and I drank lots of it.  And we would have gotten dessert since we love Greek pastries, but felt it would be a disappointment after everything else failed to meet our basic expectations.  Perhaps their other dishes are wonderful, but it is hard for me to trust a kitchen that doesn't bother to put any pride in the french fries or roasted potatoes they serve since they accompany almost every dish.  I felt the kitchen skimped on ingredients and did not produce dishes that made full use of all the wonderful seasonings you find with most Greek and Mediterranean restaurants.  In my opinion, this is more like the \"Waffle House\" of Greek restaurants...bright, loud and cheesy atmosphere with food that you shouldn't expect to be chef quality.\n",

After the hostess returns, she saw my reservation on her screen, then said \"hmm, we don't have too many tables, do you want to sit at the bar?\".... Wait a min., I thought that's what reservations are for.   I insisted a table is preferable and she went to the dining area and cleaned up a table for me.  Upon sitting, I notice that there are empty tables all over the place  .....   This is not good impression.\n",

It came w/ 2 grilled whole spring onions... wished it was a veg that's more edible, like asparagus, rather than one that's for decoration only.  Portion size was small, but then it's $7, not $15.

And yet, she tried to seat me DIRECTLY next to another person at a table, even though the whole space where the tables were was empty.  I said no, I'd like to sit over there please (referring to a small table on the other side) and she obliged.  It just seemed like common sense and common courtesy to me.

It was extremely awkward because the rest of the area was just about empty and fairly quiet, and they were so close to me.  I was irritated; she easily could have sat them at any other of the 5 empty tables and the waitress assigned to that area wouldn't have been inconvenienced.  I was going to try to tough it out, but the woman at the table turned out to be particularly loud, borderline obnoxious in my opinion.  I put on my headphones (not earbuds, but headphones) to drown her out, even though I'd intended specifically to come there to read while I ate dinner.  Could still hear her loud and clear.  I tactfully asked the waitress if they had a table available up front, and she responds, \"no, they're all taken.  I can serve you here\" pointing to the table 4 inches to my right.  I responded \"No, that would be the same thing\", trying to maintain my tone of voice.  And though my request to be moved was clearly code for \"get me out of here please! NOW.\", she wouldn't oblige.  They lied.  There were tables available.  I discovered this when, only moments after they brought out my order, I quickly gathered all of my uneaten food and was walking out to leave with it.  They just didn't want to move me because of the inconvenience of either having to switch me to another waiter, or her having to serve me outside of her table area. \n",

I also agree with some of the other reviewers, they tend to take a little too long, even when it's not crowded.  I wouldn't recommend this location at all just because the service is too much of a gamble, you never know what you're gonna get.

We order probably 30 minutes after being seated and then our food comes out after another 40 minute wait.  No one comes by our table until it's time to clear our plates.  They then drop a dessert menu on our table and never returned.  We would probably be sitting there if we didn't get up to ask for the check.

However, the experience I recently had when 4 friends and I decided to grab a late-night beer on a quiet Sunday night drops this review down to two stars. On this night, there was another regular patron who was straight up frightening. He was obviously loaded, and not a very nice drunk; playing all the metal music available on the jukebox, throwing his pool cue down like a two-year-old having a temper tantrum, and standing on bar stools over the bar while pulling his pants down around his ankles (thank god he wasn't going commando!) \n",

I explained that my mother had called about a hotel stay she had seen on her work site at Westgate and that she had a different middle initial then my own but we had the same first name as it was a family name ... she said oh that's okay and confirmed everything and sent us an email confirmation for our tour ... fast forward to being on vacation in Florida at Westgate Lakes tour date ...sign in ad end up sitting there for 39 min while everyone who came in after us headed out for tour ... finally their manager Jessica calls me over and says she can't give us the tour because of descrepency with marriage status ... I'm like what !!!!! I already went over this with Westgate corporate manager Linda and she said it was fine and I was okay to come ...Jessica proceeds to tell me the tour wasnt happening and I wasn't getting my tickets ... I then Say I want my money then and she days yeah u can have ur money in 5-10 business days ... so I really get upset ... when they took the money out it wasn't in five-ten business days and we needed the money to go buy legit tickets ... she was all cold and saying I'm sorry we can't help u ... u can call corporate was all she would say ...so of course I call and they've are closed for another two hours ... I'm really mad now ... we gave up $560 and was lied to my their corporate office with them saying we were clear on verification and got up at the butt crack of dawn to drive an hour to Westgate lakes to be denied our money and our tickets .... so Jessica the manager st the location then tells us we can sit and wait for corporate but she knew the answe would still be no... after waiting two hours and trying to search online for my divorce paperwork ...I call corporate they say they can't refund my money for 5-10 days ... and no tour can be given ...I tell them if the inconvenience we went through after being lied to by their corporate manager Linda ... and they still don't do anything .. I escalate again and get another manager who tells me u can pay the difference of the $560 of $221 and pay for yeh full price of the tickets which by the way cost more then the tickets are at the gate .. and taking the lesser of the two evils we pay the extra because we don't want to get screwed out of money we needed for vacation and paid the fee ...so I tell the lady to stay on the phone until we get the tickets from Jessica ... she tells me on the phone to go to the counter and ask for Jessica ... I go up and say can I speak with Jessica the manager ... and the lady behind the desk says 'yes, please and thank you' and she stands and walks off ... where do these horrible customer service reps get their nerve ... who in their right mind would get a time Share with these idiots ... so I'm still on the phone  and I tell the manger on the phone 'did u hear that, she was completely rude and for what... that wa smh first time speaking to her'... the phone manager asks me to get her name as she's building a file ... so I ask the lady at the counter who had been sitting next to her and .. she says I can't say it's a different department ... and she clams up ... i tell the phone manager they they refused to give names and she goes on to say that she will get details during the investigation and so u finally get Jessica back and ask her the names and she says she can't say because her Custer agents are from a different department .... the phone manager then says she can't really say what's happened as she can only make out a little info as she's having phone sound difficulty ... what a joke !!!!!!.... these reps really know how to lie and cheat they're way out of anything and have the worst customer service and people skills ever !!!... if they are like this on a tour ... imagine having them as a time share location ...... run !!!!!...... they take no accountability for their own actions and basically lie and scheme to take money off the unexpected !...I'm the end I got my tickets and they too were the wrong ones to the wrong park .... lawsuit and bank dispute in their future from me!\n",

One time she yelled at me for holding a plastic cup with water in it  behind the counter, while another employee was telling me a procedure. I'm not allowed to drink beverages in front of customers but I wasn't even drinking it whatsoever, she was just overreacting. There was literally no positive reinforcement when I would do things right immediately after being taught, almost like I was expected to do everything perfectly the first time. She gave me anxiety when she was around and never made me feel welcomed. Also, half of the employees are supervisors but it's hard to tell who is who when it's so mismanaged as it was at the bakery.

He denied ever doing business with restaurant.com.  Mind you, this goes completely against what the server told us.  The server said that they stopped accepting them which means they did at one time.  The manager denied this and basically told me we were out of luck.  I explained that the sole purpose of even coming here to try this place out was the incentive of the gift certificate.  In fact we had ordered more food then we normally would to satisfy the requirements of the gift certificate, further inflating our bill.  He didn't care.

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, North Carolina style, topped with homemade cole slaw which was supposed to come on a sour dough roll??  The pulled pork was great but the bread could not support nor compliment the sandwich.  It literally turned to mush on the bottom and was inedible.  I did however wolf down the pulled pork which was delicious.  The bread ruined the sandwich.  The same was true for my wife's sandwich which was chicken tips.  Part of the problem could be that the sandwiches are served in a plastic basket lined with a piece of paper that also turns soggy along with the bread.  Too bad.  The menu looked interesting and I would have liked to return and tried more but, as a result, I won't be returning.  A $9.50 sandwich should be made with better bread.\n",
